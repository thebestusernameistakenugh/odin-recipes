            <p> A strange bun is a cooked dish made in the upgraded farmhouse after obtaining the recipe for it from Shane in the mail after you have gained seven hearts with him. Strange Buns can also be dropped by a Shadow Brute, in the Stardrop Saloon's trash & it will occasionally be in stock at the Traveling Cart</p>
            <p><em>Note: For this recipe we will already assume that you not only have seven hearts with Shane but you also have not only seven hearts with shane but you're also past or near the end of the game as this is considered a late game item </em></p>
